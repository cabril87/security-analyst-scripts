# Security Analyst Scripts

Welcome to the **Security Analyst Scripts** repository! This project is a collection of automation scripts crafted for security analysts to monitor, analyze, and enhance the security of IT systems. Whether you’re investigating potential threats, auditing configurations, or performing routine security checks, these scripts aim to save time and provide actionable insights. The repo supports both Windows and Linux environments, with scripts written in Bash, PowerShell, and Python to cater to diverse systems and preferences.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to equip security analysts with practical tools to:
- **Detect Threats:** Identify suspicious activities like failed logins or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Monitor Systems:** Check network services, user privileges, and system logs for anomalies.
- **Automate Tasks:** Streamline repetitive security checks to focus on analysis rather than manual effort.

This repo is designed for security professionals, system administrators, or anyone interested in bolstering system security through scripting. It’s a living project—new scripts and improvements are encouraged!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories, `windows/` and `linux/`, each containing subdirectories for different scripting languages. This structure ensures scripts are easy to find based on the target OS and preferred toolset.

- Empty directories may contain a `.gitkeep` file to ensure they appear on GitHub.
- Scripts are grouped by OS and language for clarity and maintainability.
